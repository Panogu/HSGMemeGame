## **Background**
The following project is a submission of a student team (see authors) as part of the decentral examination of the course (see Course). For this, the team sought to take on a project which meets the requirements of the course and which is interesting enough to be pursued beyond the end of the course.  
For this, we chose the HSG Meme Game, which is a game for students of the University of St.Gallen. It's a fun activity based on jokes centered around the university, it's chlich√©es and the student life around it. 
## **Game rules**
Every player has 7 text cards on their hand. Each round one of the players is a judge and the others are players. For each round one meme is shown on the screen and each one of the players is putting a text card which they believe is funniest to that particular meme. Then the judge sees all the text cards and picks the funniest one which is also the winner card. The player to first win 7 rounds has won the game.  
The detailed game rules can be viewed in the seperate Game rules file.
## **Technical implementation - Overview**
The project consists of three main elements: the backend, the django framework in between and the frontend.
### **1) The backend**
The backend includes the game logic, programmed in python. Also, here we access the various memes stored as .png and .gif files and the text cards stored as a .csv file.  
We then access these files and distribute them throughout the game. We store the variables per player and keep counting them throughout the game.  
The backend includes the following files:
- .py = ABC  
- .py = ABC  
- .py = ABC  
### **2) The django framework**
The django framework is a high-level Python Web framework which is frequently used in rapid development environments due to its clean design and easy usability.  
- URLs.py: A URL mapper is used to redirect HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the request URL. The URL mapper can also match particular patterns of strings or digits that appear in a URL and pass these to a view function as data.  
- View.py: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. Views access the data needed to satisfy requests via models, and delegate the formatting of the response to templates.  
- Models.py: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database.  
### **3) The frontend**
The frontend is coded in HTML and CSS. It creates the visual elements and the site with which the users can engage.  
The frontend consists of XX different screens which are all relevant to the game. On each site there are buttons and other elements with which the users can interact to steer the flow of the game.   
The frontend includes the following files:  
- .hrml = ABC  
- .css = ABC
